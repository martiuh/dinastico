## Goals to alpha
- Development features
  - Webpack dev middleware instead of webpack dev server
  - Chokidar to watch the pages/ folder and expect a new .js file, when it happens build a new router and serve the app again
- ~~Programatically build a production Router from the src/pages folder~~
- Dinastico-Link tries to guess if the dynamic url is part of our routing strategy
- Build a file system for static reachable urls and a .htaccess file to support url parameters
